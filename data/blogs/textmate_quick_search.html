  TextMate supports an emacs style quick search, using "ctrl-s".
  Press ctrl-s and start typing a search term; TextMate will search
  as you type.

<p>
  Press "ctrl-s" or "shift-ctrl-s" to find previous and
  find next.  When you're done, press "enter" to exit the search.

  I've always found the normal find dialog a little clumsy when I want to
  just quickly search for something; thanks to <a href='https://peepcode.com/products/advanced-git'>this
  Git Peepcode screencast</a> for showing me the light.
